# Live Session Demos in Data Science
### Introduction
In this repository, I have uploaded and adapted R code in order to demonstrate some ways of Doing Data Science.  I have adapted my original R scripts to create R Markdown files which explicitly document files as though I were teaching.  Activities range from very basic Introductions to complex topics like Financial Modeling.  I will release new code as I create it, usually the week after assigning the relevant homework.

You should use RStudio to view things like the .RMD file, but I do my best to keep the .md with relevant pictures, so you can view all output on GitHub, without having to clone things yourself.  This is a work in progress!

### Structure
I plan on having one folder for each semester that I have created material.  Below is a basic representation of the file structure, starting with the Root Directory.

**SMUDoingDataScience (root)**

* \[Semester][Year]: (i.e., **Fall2017**): the Demos
    * Unit1
         - Demo.Rmd
         - Demo.md
         - Demo.html
    * Unit2
         - Demo2.Rmd
         - Demo2.md
         - Demo2.html
    * ...
    * UnitN
         - DemoN.Rmd
         - DemoN.md
         - DemoN.html 
    * Readme.md - Topics for each unit
* **data**: the data sets called for the Demo activities
    * data.csv
    * ...
    * Readme.md

## Use Terms
I am more than happy to provide help with understanding or updating this code.  I will be hopefully creating a new folder each semester.  Keep in mind that prior semesters may be different in terms of material from a current semester.  I must ask not to use these materials in an academically dishonest manner.  If there is ever a proprietary or otherwise problematic data set, I will flag it as such.  This GitHub is meant to be used for instructional, educational uses only.
